## Zipper - A Python Tool for Zipping Folders For CS Homework

### **Overview:**
A user-friendly Python application with a graphical interface that simplifies the process of zipping a folder and updating the zip file when changes are made.

### **Features:**

1. **Folder Selection:**
   - A button to browse and select the folder you want to zip.
   - Display the path of the selected folder in the GUI.

2. **Zip File Creation:**
   - Automatically zip the selected folder when prompted.
   - Save the zip file to a default location or allow the user to choose the destination.

3. **Rezip Functionality:**
   - A "Rezip" button that replaces the previously created zip file with an updated one reflecting any changes made to the folder's contents.
   - Ensure that the previous zip file is overwritten without creating duplicates.

4. **Status Notifications:**
   - Display messages or prompts indicating the success or failure of zip and rezip operations.
   - Inform the user when the process is complete.

5. **User Interface:**
   - Clean and intuitive layout.
   - Include necessary buttons: "Select Folder," "Zip," and "Rezip."
   - Optional menu bar for additional settings or help.

### **Dependencies:**

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
- **GUI Framework:** Tkinter (built-in), PyQt5, or wxPython
- **Modules and Libraries:**
  - `os` and `shutil` for file and directory operations.
  - `zipfile` module for creating and managing zip files.
  - `tkinter.filedialog` for folder selection dialogs.

### **Steps to Develop the Application:**

1. **Set Up the Development Environment:**
   - Install necessary libraries (if not using Tkinter).
   - Ensure Python is updated to the latest version.

2. **Design the GUI Layout:**
   - Create the main window.
   - Add labels, buttons, and text fields as required.
   - Arrange the components for optimal user experience.

3. **Implement Folder Selection:**
   - Code the functionality for the "Select Folder" button.
   - Use `filedialog.askdirectory()` to allow folder selection.
   - Display the selected folder path in the GUI.

4. **Develop the Zip Functionality:**
   - Write a function to zip the selected folder using the `zipfile` module.
   - Allow the user to specify the save location or use a default path.
   - Handle exceptions and errors during the zipping process.

5. **Implement the Rezip Feature:**
   - Check if a zip file already exists for the selected folder.
   - Overwrite the existing zip file with the updated contents.
   - Ensure file locks or permissions do not prevent overwriting.

6. **Add Status Notifications:**
   - Use message boxes or a status bar to inform the user of the process.
   - Display success messages or error alerts as needed.

7. **Test the Application:**
   - Perform unit tests on each function.
   - Test the entire workflow to ensure reliability.
   - Check compatibility across different operating systems if possible.

8. **Optimize and Refine:**
   - Improve the user interface based on usability.
   - Optimize code for efficiency.
   - Add comments and documentation within the code.

### **Optional Enhancements:**

- **Drag and Drop Functionality:**
  - Allow users to drag a folder into the application window to select it.

- **Progress Bar:**
  - Show a progress indicator during the zipping process for large folders.

- **Settings Menu:**
  - Options to include or exclude certain file types.
  - Ability to change the default save location.

- **Error Logging:**
  - Create logs for any errors encountered during operations.

### **What You'll Need to Do:**

- **Familiarize Yourself with the GUI Framework:**
  - If you're new to Tkinter or the chosen framework, review tutorials and documentation.

- **Plan the Application Structure:**
  - Decide on how you'll organize your code (e.g., using classes or functions).

- **Write and Test Code Iteratively:**
  - Develop the application in small parts, testing each feature as you go.

- **Gather Feedback:**
  - If possible, have someone else test the application to catch any issues you might have missed.

- **Prepare for Deployment:**
  - If you need to run the application on other machines, consider packaging it with tools like PyInstaller to create an executable.
